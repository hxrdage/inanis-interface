before unpacking files with replacement, make a backup copy of the files!
1. unzip the images in a path (with replacement): "E:\mta\MTA\cgui\" - each has its own path where the mta folder is located.
2. move the folder to the specified path: "E:\mta\skins":
(will look something like this {
    1. Classic
    2. Default
    3. Lighter black
    4. inanis
})
3. so we set the interface manually ;)
4. launch the game and go to the game settings, click on the interface tab and select our skin: "inanis"
5. apply and enjoy the gameplay :)

interface and skin author: Engine :P
enjoy, thank you for your attention and understanding!
